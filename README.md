### *About the App*
hikeME is an interactive full-stack hiking application that allows users to browse Maine's best trails. Trail data includes: GoogleMaps location data, elevation gain, length, trail difficulty, weather conditions, and more. User features of hikeME include searching the database, adding/deleting comments on trails, contributing trails to the collection, browsing upcoming lunar & celestial events, and more.

### *Technologies Used*
This application was built using the MERN stack: Mongoose/Express/ React/Node.js. The database was created using MongoDB, in tandem with Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling libray. A REST API was created and called on using axios. Front-end was built out using React/CSS/&JSX. The web/server framework was built using Express. Additional developer tools leveraged were VS Code, Github, Insomnia, and commandline.
